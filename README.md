# EDA-customer_Churn-project
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a given dataset to uncover insights, identify patterns, and prepare the data for further modeling or analysis. 

This project focuses on the essential data science tasks of data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The goal is to take a raw dataset, clean it for analysis, handle missing or inconsistent values, and derive meaningful insights using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Dataset

The dataset used is [insert dataset name, e.g., Titanic, IPL dataset, Sales data, etc.].

Source: [Insert source link, e.g., Kaggle or a public dataset]

Size: [e.g., 891 rows, 12 columns]

Format: CSV


Objectives

Load and understand the raw dataset.

Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

Perform data type conversions and feature engineering if necessary.

Conduct EDA using visualizations to uncover patterns and trends.

Generate actionable insights.


Tools & Libraries

Python 3.11+

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn


Key Steps

1. Importing the Dataset


2. Initial Data Exploration

df.info(), df.describe(), df.isnull().sum(), etc.



3. Data Cleaning

Handling missing values (mean, median, mode imputation or dropping).

Removing duplicates.

Fixing data types (e.g., converting object to datetime).



4. EDA and Visualization

Univariate and bivariate analysis.

Correlation heatmaps.

Bar plots, histograms, box plots, etc.



5. Insights and Conclusions

Sample Insights

[e.g., "Sales peaked in December with a 30% increase over the yearly average."]
